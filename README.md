# Getting started
## Installation
Navigate into the git repository.
Create a new python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
You should now see `(.venv)` in the terminal, indicating that the environment is active.

With the environment active, install the required python packages:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
That's it.

## Running the main script
Make sure the virtual environment `(.venv)` is active.
Run
```bash
python main.py
```
